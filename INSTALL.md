# Game Rules
Your mission is to make it out alive. You will take a turn to `play [card]` and\
 play whatever card you have in your hand. After using up your energy, you `end` \
 your turn and wait to see the damage that has been dealt. You will eventually \
 choose a door with `go [door number]`. The chance state will perhaps provide \
 you with some luck against your  enemies. Shop encounter will give you the \
 opportunity to buy new cards if you are dealt a bad hand. Camp encounter will\
  give you the energy and health you need to keep on fighting. 

When you are confused, use the `help` command to see what commands are avaible \
to you. Good luck!
